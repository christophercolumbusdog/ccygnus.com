	<p>Hi, my name is Christian Cygnus and  I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In high school,
		I participated in both business and computer related clubs. During the 2014-2015 school year, I served as Vice President for my school's chapter of
		the Future Business Leaders of America, and I co-founded Byte Club, the very first programming club to start at Mundelein High School. I competed in
		many computer and programming events through FBLA, even placing 9th in the naiton for Computer Game and Simulation Programming with my team of 3. My
		other hobbies include film-making/cinematography and acting.
	</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigArt (an ACM special interest group for artificial intelligence), ACM SigMobile (an ACM special interest group for android mobile development), and going to HackIllinois and other exciting hackathons. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
